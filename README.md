Genetic Algorithm Project-Natural Selection

Ball-represents an individual

Need to create a gene collection for an individual: [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k]

What attributes will an individual have?
	color-> rgb value (3 genes)
	displacement-> x, y (2 genes)
	ability to fight-> (1 gene)
	sex-> (1 gene)

Need to specify a preference in terms of color -> more likely to reproduce
Females all of a certain color?

Biological clock-> sexual maturity, death
Hunger/Thirst clock

Include ressources->food/water
Include predator

Start with 2+ populations with different characteristics?
